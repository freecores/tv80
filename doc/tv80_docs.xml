<abstract><t>
A synthesizable 8-bit microprocessor which is instruction-set compatable
with the Z80, targetted at embedded and system-on-a-chip designs.
</t></abstract>

    <section title="Background">
        <t>The tv80 core was created as a Verilog port of the <xref target="t80">VHDL T80 core</xref>, for use as a maintenence processor inside an ASIC.
            The tv80 has been modified since then for better synthesis
            timing/area results, and to incorporate several bug-fixes.</t>
        <t>The T80, and the tv80 derived from it, attempt to maintain the
            original cycle timings of the Z80, but have radically different
            internal designs and timings.  With its target being ASIC and
            embedded applications, the tv80 does not attempt to maintain
            the original pinout of the Z80.</t>
    </section>
<section title="Verification Environment">
 <section title="Memory Map">
<t>
Environment memory space is divided into a 32k ROM region and a 32k RAM
region, as follows:

<figure>
<artwork>
  0000-7FFF:  ROM
  8000-FFFF:  RAM
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>Environment I/O space is allocated as follows:</t>

<figure>
<artwork>
  00-0F:  Unused
  10-1F:  Test devices
  20-7F:  Unused
  80-9F:  Environment control
  A0-FF:  Unused
</artwork></figure>
</t>
 </section>
 <section title="Control Registers">
The tv80 environment is controlled by the program under simulation.  The
program can affect the environment through a set of control registers,
which are mapped into I/O space.

  <section title="Simulation control (0x80)">

    <list style="symbols">
     <t>   Write '01' to end simulation with test passed</t>
     <t>   Write '02' to end with test failed</t>
     <t>   Write '03' to turn on dumping</t>
     <t>   Write '04' to turn off dumping</t>
    </list>
  </section>

  <section title="Message output (0x81)">
<t>
        Write characters to this port one at a time.  When the
        newline ('\n', ASCII 0x0A) character is written, the 
        environment will print out the collected string.
</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Timeout control (0x82)">
    <t>
        Bit[0] enables the timeout counter,
        Bit[1] resets the counter to 0.
        Timeout counter defaults to enabled at simulation start.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Max timeout (0x84, 0x83)">
   <t>
        Holds 16-bit timeout value (amount of time in clocks before
        timeout error occurs).
   </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Interrupt countdown (0x90)">
    <t>
        When set, starts a countdown (in clocks) until assertion of
        the INT_N signal.
   </t>
  </section>
  <section title="Checksum value (0x91)">
    <t>This register holds the checksum value of all data
       written to the accumulate register.  The checksum is a simple
       twos-complement checksum, so it can be compared with a CPU-generated 
       checksum.</t>
    <t>This register is readable and writeable.  Writing the register sets
       the current checksum value.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Checksum accumulate (0x92)">
    <t>This write-only register adds the written value to the value
       contained in the Checksum Value register.</t>
  </section>
  <section title="Increment on read (0x93)">
    <t>This register increments every time it is read, so reading it
       repeatedly generates an incrementing sequence.  It can be reset
       by writing it to a new starting value.</t>
  </section>

 </section>
 <section title="Tool Chain">
     <t>The minimum toolchain required to simulate the tv80 is the
         <xref target="cver">CVer</xref> Verilog simulator, and the
         <xref target="sdcc">SDCC</xref> compiler/assembler/linker.  In
         addition, to run the <xref target="tvs80">tvs80</xref> instruction
         test suite, the <xref target="dosbox">DOSBox</xref> DOS emulator
         is required.
     </t>
 </section>
 <section title="Tests">
   <t>Most of the tests in the tv80 environment are written in C, and should
       be compiled with the <xref target="sdcc">sdcc</xref> compiler.  
   </t>
     <section anchor="tvs80" title="tvs80 test">
      <t>The tvs80 test is different than the rest of the tests, and is 
         written in its own flavor of assembly language.  This test provides
         a fairly comprehensive Z80 instruction test.</t>
      <t>The assembler for this test only runs under DOS.  To assemble
          under Unix/Linux, the <xref target="dosbox">"dosbox" DOS emulator</xref> is required.  A script
         to run the assembler under dosbox, as well as the tvs80.asm source,
         is checked in under the "tests/tvs80" directory.</t>
